# Aprendizaje a tu medida
This is a project that's mainly an e-learning platform that focuses more on students' learning
type. This system evaluates students into three types of learning types:
- Visual
- Auditive
- Kinesthetic

The evaluation is made with a psychological test made from the Veracruz University.
Once that the student has been assigned with one learning type, this data helps their
teachers of each course that they are enrolled as statistics so the teacher can see how many
visual, auditive or kinesthetic students they have on the course and this can help them to
give ideal material to them, such as videos, audios or some kind of exercise to them as
didactic material or even some homework for them to make. The platform has the same
tools as a lot of other platforms such as course enrollment, homework evaluation and even a
chat so you can speak with anybody that is registered on the platform
